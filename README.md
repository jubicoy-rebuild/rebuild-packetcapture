# RE:BUILD

## C.H.I.P Access Point for Capturing Packets

Construct a system to snoop packets from the traffic running through the WIFI AP. Integrate 2x16 LCD screen to provide important information 
about the status of the system.

You can also develope some sort of API for the admin to easily fetch/query the snooped data.

Focus on:
- Properly capturing and storing important data from the traffic
- Good documentation for users to setup similar environment
- Easy way for admin to check the status of the system, such as the LCD infoscreen
- Adding more functionalities to make the use of the system easier, such as API for fetching data
